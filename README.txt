IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR USING THE DATA SCRAPER / UPDATER:

1) This folder is meant to be hosted in a google drive. The notebooks contain instructions on how to use them. They are located in the "Updaters" folder, along with their configuration files that set the parameters (the notebooks and configuration files explain that in detail).

2) The "Masters" folder contains the master spreadshets used to keep track of the data SVED has gathered over the years. Do not upload new versions of the master sheets. They are in a specific format that the notebooks are made to recognize. You are welcome to download them as many times as you want.

3) Do not move files around or rename them. The notebooks use the file directories I specified, so they will break if you move things to the wrong place or rename them!

3) The "SVED Economic Profiles Auto-Updaters" folder must be hosted in your "My Drive" folder. If it is not, please move the entire folder there now.

Thanks!
