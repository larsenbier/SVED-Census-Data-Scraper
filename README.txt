IMPORTANT INFO ON THE PYTHON NOTEBOOKS AND THE MASTER SHEETS.

1) Use google colab to open the python notebooks (".ipynb" files). They do not require installing python or any python libraries, and google will open them in google colab by default. The notebooks contain instructions on how to use them. They are located in the "Updaters" folder, along with their configuration files that set the parameters (the notebooks and configuration files explain that in detail).

2) Do not upload new versions of the master sheets. They are in a specific format that the python code depends on to work properly. You are welcome to download them as many times as you want.

3) Do not move files around or rename them without making sure it won't break something. The notebooks use the file directories I specified, so they will break if you move things to the wrong place or rename them!

3) The "SVED Economic Profiles Auto-Updaters" folder must be hosted in your "My Drive" folder. If it is not, please move the entire folder there now.

Thanks!
